<hr>
<p>Aron A. of HotNewHipHop mentions that Rico Beats and 808MeloBeats "bring together elements from grime and drill to form a truly unique style tailored perfectly for Pop Smoke".[24] Danny Schwartz of Rolling Stone commented the mixtape "filtered New York City's tradition of raucous, streetwise melodramas through the militant spirit of Chicago drill and the woozy, haunting production of London drill".[25] DeMicia Inman for Def Pen stated the opening track "Meet the Woo" has "quick, rhythmic verses with a smooth, deep bass voice drastically different from the melodic rap popular now".[10] Pop Smoke told Genius that "Welcome to the Party" was not about girls but the streets and gangs.[7] It is followed by drill[26] track "Hawk Em", where Pop Smoke raps: "I'm a gentlemen and gangster/Double G, niggas know there's only one of me."[27] In the fourth song "Better Have Your Gun", Pop Smoke goes from being "ignorant bravado" to being evil and playful, rapping about designer brands.[28]

Alphonse Pierre of Pitchfork commented that Pop Smoke's vocals on "Scenario" are "harrowing and Marvel-supervillain worthy, the beat a haunted amusement park".[28] "Dior" is a drill[29] and hip hop[30] track with lyrics about flirting with women and buying the latest designer clothes.[31][32] David Crone of AllMusic opined that "Feeling" has "slushy tones" and that it sounds "sluggish rather than impactful".[26] In "PTSD", Pop Smoke uses a spoken word approach instead of rapping.[33][34] Pop Smoke mentions about getting his revenge seven years later on a kid for hitting him, and that he is not going to any clubs without a $25,000 deposit to support his love for designer clothes.[34] Dhruva Balram of NME said the rapper talks about "the trauma he endured growing up"[33] while Michael Saponara for Billboard mentions Pop Smoke "opens up about suffering from PTSD after all of the trauma he's endured growing up in Brooklyn".[34] Crone commeneted that when Pop Smoke "sounds at home" on the closing track "Brother Man", he's "often let down by writing".[26]</p>

<h2>Reception</h2>
<hr>
<h3>critical reception</h3>
<p>Pierre, who gave the mixtape a 7.6 out of 10, said it "might be occasionally unimaginative, but overall Meet the Woo injects life into a Brooklyn drill scene that was running on fumes".[28] Jon Caramanica, writing for The New York Times stated that Meet the Woo is a mixtape "full of tossed-off threats and rowdy bluster, a soundtrack for rumbles in dark basements".[59] Writing for Vulture, Paul Thompson opined the mixtape "helped shape Brooklyn's drill scene, an emerging web of young artists who posit that New York can be just as interesting as an importer — and mutator — of other regional sounds".[8] Crone gave the mixtape two and a half stars out of five, saying Meet the Woo has "lack of direction; from aimless style-mashing to rehashed lyrics, it's hard to see the album as anything more than a collision of styles". He continues, saying it "flounders more than it flourishes. As well as a poor showing for [Pop] Smoke, this is a disappointing mainstream statement from Brooklyn's otherwise vibrant scene".[26]</p>
